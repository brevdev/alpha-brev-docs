# Welcome to Brev

Brev is a developer environment handling the infrastructure so you can focus on your code.


## Getting Started With Brev

=== "CLI"

    Install the CLI: 

    Using homebrew, run

    ```bash
    brew install brevdev/tap/brev
    ```

    Or you can download the binary [here](https://github.com/brevdev/brev-go-cli/releases)

    Initialize a new Brev project by creating a directory, then running `init`.

    ```bash
    mkdir super-project
    cd super-project
    brev init
    ```


=== "Console"
    
    Simply go to the [console](http://app.brev.dev).

    You can use the default project, or create a new project from the project dropdown.
