## How To Add Environment Variables

You can add environment variables to any Brev endpoint. It's a good practice to avoid using secret keys and other system level variables directly in the code. 

From the CLI, use the `add` command on the `variable` resource:

`brev variable add MY_SECRET_KEY`

This will prompt you to enter the value, and that's it! Freely use the variable in your code, insuring variables is imported:

```python
import variables

def get():
    print(f"Secret Key: {MY_SECRET_KEY}")
    return{}
```

Doing this will make your code more secure, since the secret keys are encrypted and not pushed as part of your code. Additionally, your code will be cleaner since changing this variable only needs to happen in one place, no matter how often you use the variable.
